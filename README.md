# A Hesitant Fuzzy Envelope Based Expert System in Human Decision Making

Research Paper: https://doi.org/10.3126/njmathsci.v2i1.36503

## ABSTRACT
Naturally, individual decision style is qualitative rather than quantitative settings. In nature, the human way of thinking is uncertain and fuzziness that demands the use of the linguistic approach of problems related to the decision. The group decision making process is highly affected by hesitant situations among the members for clarity-based decisions. In order to remove the hesitant situations, the proposed Hesitant Fuzzy Envelope expert system provides the group decision making processes with more realistic output in envelope form rather than CRISP one. In this study, we shall discuss a linguistic based expert system that will help to make more realistic decisions in a hesitant situation by using Hesitant Fuzzy Envelope technique.
